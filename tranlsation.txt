 There be once a adorable girl that be want by all that that know prpers , but especially by his grandma , and do not remain at all that prpers have not give prpers to the girl . Once prpers give prpers a small *caperuza$  or *gorrito$  of a red colour , that remain prpers so well that prpers never want use another thing , so prpers begin prpers to call *Caperucita$  Red . A day his mother say prpers : prpers See , *Caperucita$  Red , here have a cake and a bottle of wine , spend prpers to prpers in this basket to your grandma that this *enfermita$  and feeble and this will help prpers . Go prpers now early , before hot the day , and on the way , walk calm and with care , do not avert prpers of the route , do not go to fall prpers and break the bottle and do not remain at all for your grandma . And when prpers go to his bedroom do not forget to say prpers , Good morning , ah , and do not walk *curioseando$  by all the *aposento$ . . Prpers do not concern prpers , prpers will do well everything , say *Caperucita$  Red , and take the thing and sack fondly . The grandma live in the forest , as to a kilometre of his house . And no more prpers have go *Caperucita$  Red in the forest , always inside the footpath , when prpers find with a wolf . *Caperucita$  Red do not know that this creature can do some harm , and do not have any fear to prpers . Good morning , *Caperucita$  Red , say the wolf . Good morning , amiable wolf . - Where go so early , *Caperucita$  Red ? - Home of my grandma . - And what spend in this basket ? - Cake and wine . Yesterday prpers go day of *hornear$ , so my poor ailing grandma go to have something well to strengthen . - And where live your grandma , *Caperucita$  Red ? - As to half kilometre more inside in the forest . His house be under three big oak , at the side of some hazel . Surely already prpers will have see prpers , prpers answer innocently *Caperucita$  Red . The wolf say in silence to himself same : Which so tender creature ! What good *bocadito$  - and will be more *sabroso$  that this *viejita$ . So prpers have act with delicacy to obtain to both easily . Then prpers accompany to *Caperucita$  Red a small tract of the path and afterwards say prpers : prpers Look *Caperucita$  Red , that cute flower see by there , why do not go and collect some ? And prpers create also that prpers have not @darse# cuenta$  of the sweet that sing the *pajaritos$ . Prpers be that prpers go so *apurada$  on the way as if prpers go for the school , whereas all the forest be full of marvel . . *Caperucita$  Red raise his eye , and when prpers see the ray of the sun *danzando$  here and there among the tree , and see the beautiful flower and the edge of the bird , think : prpers Suppose that prpers can spend prpers one of this fresh flower to my grandma and that will love prpers . Besides , still prpers be very early and there will be problem if prpers retard prpers a *poquito$ , always will arrive to good hour . And like this , prpers exit of the path and go to cut flower . And when prpers cut one , see another more beautiful , and another and another , and without @darse be *adentrando$  in the forest . In the meantime the wolf take the time and run direct to the house of the grandma and touch to the door . Who be ? Prpers ask the grandma . *Caperucita$  Red , answer the wolf . Prpers bring cake and wine . Open prpers , please . - Prpers move the lock and open prpers , shout the grandma , be very feeble and can not prpers raise . The wolf move the lock , open the door , and without say a word more , be direct to the bed of the grandma and of a bite swallow prpers to prpers . And immediately prpers put clothes of prpers , plant a cap , dip in the bed and close the curtain . . In the meantime , *Caperucita$  Red have remain *colectando$  flower , and when prpers see that have so many that no longer can spend more , agree of his grandma and put in path to prpers . When prpers arrive , prpers surprise when find the open door , and when go to the house , feel so odd presentiment that say for himself same : Oh God ! That uncomfortable seat prpers today , and other time that have like prpers so much be with grandma . Then prpers shout : Good morning ! , but there be not response , so prpers be to the bedroom and open the curtain . There prpers look to be the grandma with his cap cover prpers all the face , and with a very odd appearance . ! Oh , grandma ! Prpers say , which so big ear that have . - Prpers be to hear prpers good , my girl , go the response . But grandma , which so big eye that have . - Prpers be to see prpers good , want . - But grandma , which so big arm that have . - To embrace prpers good . - And which so big mouth that have . - To eat prpers good . And prpers have not end to say the anterior , when of a jump exit of the bed and swallow also to *Caperucita$  Red . . Then the wolf decide to do a *siesta$  and go to throw in the bed , and once asleep begin to *roncar$  strongly . A hunter that by chance spend in this moment by there , listen the strong *ronquidos$  and think , How *ronca$  this *viejita$ ! Prpers go to see if prpers need some help . Then *ingresó$  to the bedroom , and when prpers approach to the bed see to the wolf throw there . So prpers find prpers here , old sinner ! Prpers say prpers . Prpers do time that look prpers ! And already prpers have to shoot his weapon against prpers , when prpers think that the wolf can have devour to the *viejita$  and that still can be save , by what decide not shoot . In his place take some scissors and begin to cut the belly of the wolf *durmiente$ . In what prpers have do two court , see to shine a *gorrita$  red , then do two court more and the small *Caperucita$  Red exit very fast , shout : What scare that be , what dark that be here inside the wolf ! , and immediately prpers exit also the grandma , *vivita$ , but that almost can not breathe . Quickly , *Caperucita$  Red bring a lot of stone with which fill the belly of the wolf . And when the wolf wake , *quizo$  run and go far , but the stone be so heavy that do not endure the endeavour and fall die . . The three person feel happy . The hunter remove prpers the skin to the wolf and spend prpers to prpers to his house . The grandma eat the cake and drink the wine that bring prpers *Caperucita$  Red and revive . But *Caperucita$  Red only think : While alive , never will remove prpers of the footpath to confine prpers in the forest , thing that my mother there be prpers already forbid do . . Also prpers say that again that *Caperucita$  Red spend cake to the grandma , another wolf speak prpers , and treat to do that prpers exit of the footpath . However *Caperucita$  Red already be on the defensive , and follow direct in his path . When arrive , count prpers to his grandma that have find with another wolf and that have hail prpers with good morning , but with a so suspicious gaze , that if prpers have not be because prpers be in the public road , of sure that have swallow prpers to prpers . Well , prpers say the grandma , will close well the door , so that prpers can not *ingresar$ . Afterwards , to the cape of a while , arrive the wolf and touch to the door and shout : prpers Open grandma that be *Caperucita$  Red and bring prpers some cake ! But prpers *callaron$  and do not open the door , so that *hocicón$  put to give turn around the house and of last jump on the ceiling and seat to expect that *Caperucita$  Red return to his house to the dusk for then jump on prpers and devour prpers in the darkness . But the grandma know very well his bad intention . At the head of the house there be a big pot , so prpers say prpers to the girl : prpers Look *Caperucita$  Red , yesterday do some rich sauce , by what bring with water the *cubeta$  in which prpers cook prpers , to the pot that be outside . And prpers fill the big pot to his maximum , add delicious condiment . And prpers begin that delicious aroma to arrive to the nose of the wolf , and begin to aspire and to walk to that exquisite smell . And prpers walk until arrive to the bank of the ceiling and pull so much his head that slip and fall of *bruces$  exactly to the centre of the pot *hirviente$ , drown and cook immediately . And *Caperucita$  Red return sure to his house and from now on always take of not fall in the cheat of which look to hurt . .
